## Usage

This project simulates an open-source community with different agent roles and task assignments.

### How to run the simulation

1. **Clone the repository** 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OREL-group/GSoC
    cd GSoC/2025/SustainHub
    ```

2. **Make sure you have Python 3 installed** (preferably 3.7+).

3. **Run the simulation script:**

    ```bash
    python3 simulation.py
    ```

### What happens

- The simulation creates agents representing community roles: Maintainer, Contributor, Innovator, and Knowledge Curator.
- Each agent gets assigned tasks randomly, such as bug fixes or feature development.
- The output shows which agent is assigned what task at each step.
