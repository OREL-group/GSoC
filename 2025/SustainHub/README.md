# SustainHub

**SustainHub** is a Reinforcement Learning–powered simulation for studying and enhancing the sustainability of open-source communities. It models real-world OSS dynamics through a combination of Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) for task allocation and SARSA for agent-level learning and decision-making.

The system is built around four specialized agents representing common roles in OSS: Maintainer, Contributor, Innovator, and Knowledge Curator.

## Objectives

- Simulate task allocation and agent behavior in OSS environments.
- Optimize contributor engagement using MAB and SARSA.
- Promote sustainable collaboration through intelligent agent decisions.
- Track community health via custom metrics like Harmony Index and Resilience Quotient.

## Key Components

### Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)

Used by the Maintainer to allocate tasks to agents. MAB uses Thompson Sampling to balance exploration and exploitation based on agent performance on different task types.

> See: `mab.py`

### SARSA Learning

Each agent (Contributor, Innovator, Knowledge Curator) uses SARSA to learn optimal actions from interaction history — enabling them to improve their task responses over time.

## Agent Roles

| Agent               | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Maintainer          | Allocates tasks using a MAB-based strategy that adapts over time. |
| Contributor         | Specializes in bug fixes; learns which bugs to tackle using SARSA. |
| Innovator           | Builds new features; learns how to prioritize ideas effectively. |
| Knowledge Curator   | Improves documentation; learns how to respond to doc-related tasks. |

## How It Works

1. Maintainer uses MAB to assign tasks to available agents.
2. Each agent (Contributor, Innovator, Curator) learns using the SARSA algorithm:
   - States can include current load, last task success, etc.
   - Actions include accepting/rejecting or prioritizing tasks.
3. Task outcomes are scored, affecting the reward signal.
4. Harmony and Resilience metrics are tracked and logged.

## Metrics Tracked

- Task success rate per agent type
- Collaboration harmony between agents
- Adaptability of agent choices over episodes
- Resilience to overload or contributor dropout
