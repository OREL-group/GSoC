## 1. Project Motivation

Open-source ecosystems rely on distributed collaboration, but they face sustainability challenges such as:  
- Uneven workload distribution leading to burnout.  
- Contributor dropouts and churn.  
- Inefficiencies in task allocation.  
- Knowledge silos reducing long-term engagement.  

SustainHub addresses these issues by simulating OSS communities as **agent-based models** that balance **efficiency (tasks completed)** and **sustainability (fairness, adaptability, inclusivity)**.  

---

## 2. Objectives

- Simulate realistic OSS task allocation and contributor behavior.  
- Balance **exploration (testing new contributors)** and **exploitation (using proven contributors)**.  
- Model individual learning and role specialization through SARSA.  
- Track community sustainability with **quantitative health metrics**.  
- Provide interactive experimentation through a GUI with simulation controls and visualizations.  

---

## 3. Reinforcement Learning Framework

### 3.1 Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)

- **Role**: Used by the **Maintainer** to allocate tasks among available agents.  
- **Algorithm**: **Thompson Sampling** is applied to model the **explorationâ€“exploitation tradeoff**.  
- **Mechanism**:  
  - Agents = levers in the bandit problem.  
  - Tasks = pulls on levers.  
  - Success/failure of task completion = observed reward.  

- **Benefits**:  
  - Ensures fairness by giving opportunities to less-used agents.  
  - Prevents stagnation by encouraging exploration.  
  - Adapts to evolving agent performance over time.  

---

### 3.2 SARSA (Stateâ€“Actionâ€“Rewardâ€“Stateâ€“Action)

- **Role**: Governs how individual agents respond to assigned tasks.  
- **Algorithm**: On-policy **Temporal Difference (TD) learning** method.  
- **State Representation**: Defined by  
  - Task type (bug, feature, documentation, other)  
  - Current workload (light, moderate, heavy)  
  - Historical success rate  

- **Actions**:  
  - Accept and attempt task.  
  - Skip task (idle).  
  - Attempt task outside specialization.  

- **Reward System**:  
  - +3 for success in specialized tasks.  
  - +1 for success in non-specialized tasks.  
  - 0 for skipping tasks.  
  - âˆ’1 for failed tasks.  

- **Advantages**:  
  - Encourages specialization while allowing flexibility.  
  - Penalizes idleness and failures.  
  - Models real OSS behavior where contributors adapt over time.  

---

### 3.3 Synergy of MAB and SARSA

- **MAB (Global Layer)**: Decides **who gets the task** based on role performance.  
- **SARSA (Local Layer)**: Decides **how the assigned agent responds** to the task.  

This layered reinforcement learning system ensures:  
- Fair global allocation of tasks.  
- Adaptive local agent learning and behavior refinement.  
- More realistic modeling of OSS collaboration.  

---

## 4. Agents

SustainHub models four specialized agent types, reflecting common OSS roles.  

| Agent Type        | Specialization                  | Reward (Success)     | Reward (Failure / Skip) |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Maintainer**        | Allocates tasks using MAB        | Indirect via efficiency | â€” |
| **Contributor**       | Bug fixing and stability         | +3 (bugs), +1 (others) | âˆ’1 / 0 |
| **Innovator**         | Feature design and implementation| +3 (features), +1 (others) | âˆ’1 / 0 |
| **Knowledge Curator** | Documentation and knowledge mgmt | +3 (docs), +1 (others) | âˆ’1 / 0 |

### Why these agents?
- **Maintainer**: Ensures efficiency and fairness in task allocation.  
- **Contributor**: Keeps the project stable by resolving bugs.  
- **Innovator**: Drives growth by adding new features.  
- **Knowledge Curator**: Maintains documentation, ensuring accessibility and long-term engagement.  

Together, they capture the **division of labor and collaboration patterns** in OSS.  

---

## 5. Community Health Metrics

SustainHub introduces three quantitative metrics to measure sustainability:

### 5.1 Harmony Index (HI)
- **Purpose**: Captures workload balance and task success rate.  
- **Formula**:  
  \[
  HI = 0.6 * AvgSuccessRate + 0.4 * ( 1 / (1 + LoadVariance) )
  \]  
- **Range**: 0 (imbalanced) â†’ 1 (perfect balance).  
- **Insight**: High HI indicates fairness and prevents burnout.  

---

### 5.2 Resilience Quotient (RQ)
- **Purpose**: Measures adaptability during disruptions (dropouts, workload spikes).  
- **Formula**:  
  \[
  RQ = 0.4 * TRE + 0.3 * SRR + 0.3 * HS
  \]  
  - TRE = Task Reallocation Efficiency  
  - SRR = Success Rate Recovery  
  - HS = Harmony Stability  

- **Range**: 0 (low) â†’ 1 (high resilience).  
- **Insight**: High RQ = system can recover smoothly from disruptions.  

---

### 5.3 Reassignment Overhead (RO)
- **Purpose**: Tracks inefficiency caused by reassigning tasks.  
- **Formula**:  
  \[
 RO = ReassignedTasks / TotalTasksAssigned
  \]  
- **Range**: 0 (efficient) â†’ 1 (highly inefficient).  
- **Insight**: Lower RO means effective first-time task allocation.  

---

## 6. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Implemented in **Tkinter** with GitHub-inspired dark theme. Divided into three tabs:

### 6.1 Logs Tab
- Configure simulation parameters: steps, agents, tasks per step, dropouts per step.  
- Real-time textual logs in a terminal-like style.  
- Export logs as `.txt`.  

### 6.2 Graphs Tab
- Interactive performance graphs for **HI, RQ, and RO** using Matplotlib.  
- Export graphs as `.png` files.  
- Color-coded metrics for clarity.  

### 6.3 Visualizer Tab
- Agents visualized as **blue circles** and tasks as **yellow squares**.  
- Animated movements simulate task allocation and completion.  
- Optional **NetLogo integration** for advanced visualizations.

## 7. Simulation Controls

- **Tasks per Step**: Defines how many tasks are generated or assigned in each simulation step. This simulates workload variation and helps analyze how agents handle different levels of demand.  

- **Dropouts per Step**: Models contributor churn by removing a certain number of agents per step. This allows testing the systemâ€™s resilience when contributors leave.  

- **Number of Steps**: Specifies the total number of iterations the simulation will run. A higher number of steps allows long-term behavior and sustainability patterns to emerge.  

- **Number of Agents per Run**: Determines how many agents are initialized at the start of each simulation run. This affects collaboration dynamics and the diversity of agent strategies.  


These controls allow stress-testing of OSS dynamics under different conditions.

## 8. How to Run

You can run SustainHub either through the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** or directly via scripts.  
Follow the steps below based on your operating system.

---

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to the [SustainHub GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/sustainhub).  
2. Click on **Fork** (top-right) to create a copy under your GitHub account.  

---

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
**For macOS/Linux:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sustainhub.git
cd GSoC/2025/SustainHub
```

**For macOS/Linux:** 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sustainhub.git
cd GSoC\2025\SustainHub
```
---
### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

Make sure you are inside the **SustainHub** folder:  

```bash
cd GSoC/2025/SustainHub
```
---

### Step 4: Run the Simulation

You can run **SustainHub** in two ways:  
1. Using the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** (`gui.py`)  
2. Running the **Core Simulation Script** (`main.py`)  

---

#### Option A: Run the GUI

The GUI provides an interactive way to control the simulation.  

**For macOS/Linux:**  
```bash
python3 gui.py
```

**For Windows:**  
```bash
python gui.py
```

**A graphical interface will open, where you can control:**

- Number of tasks per step
- Dropouts per step
- Number of steps
- Number of agents per run

#### Option B: Run inside the terminal
The simulation will start running inside the terminal if you
**For macOS/Linux:**  
```bash
python3 main.py
```

**For Windows:**  
```bash
python main.py
```

- You will see **progress logs and metrics** printed step by step.  
- **Graphs** (e.g., sustainability index, agent performance) will **pop up automatically** using matplotlib.  
- Parameters such as **number of agents, steps, and dropout rates** need to be **manually edited inside `main.py`** before running.  

---

### Output Data

Regardless of whether you use `gui.py` or `main.py`:  

- A folder named **`data/`** is automatically created in the same directory.  
- Inside `data/`, you will find:  
  - **JSON files** â†’ Storing learned **Q-values** from SARSA.  
  - **Image files (PNG/JPG)** â†’ Generated graphs and visualizations from the simulation.  

This ensures your experimental results are stored for later analysis.  

## 9. Expected Output

When you run SustainHub, you should be able to see the following outputs depending on whether you use the **GUI** or **main.py (terminal mode)**.  
All screenshots and plots should be placed in the **`images/`** folder located in the same directory as `gui.py` and `main.py`.  

---

### A. Running with GUI (`gui.py`)

![Graph Popups](images/sucess_heatmap.png)  

1. **Main GUI Window with Logs**  
   ![GUI with Logs](images/Logs.png)  
   The above image just shows the Logs of step by step agents outputs.

2. **Three Graph Popups (Metrics)**  
   - Harmony Index  ![Graph Popups](images/Harmony_Index.png)  
  A good harmony index should have a value above 0.5 and a very good harmony index will be greater than 0.75 .
   - Resilience Quotient  ![Graph Popups](images/RQ1.png) 
   A higher Resilience Quotient is better. 
   - Reassignment Overhead  ![Graph Popups](images/RO.png) 
   Reassignment overhead when 1 means that all skipped tasks are being reassigned so it is good.
