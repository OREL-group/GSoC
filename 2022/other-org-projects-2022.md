#### Interactive Applications for the Open-source Contributors Community

Support the Rokwire Community of mobile developers by creating sample applications as tutorials for new open-source contributors. [Rokwire](https://rokwire.org/) is an open-source platform for developing mobile applications that enable smart communities. Existing applications include the Illinois App (campus app for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) and Safer (a public health and COVID management app).

One prerequisite to this project is to develop a working understanding of the Rokwire architecture. A starting point for this is the [Building Blocks API](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-building-blocks-api) and various [Community Wiki](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/wiki/API-Ecosystem-Diagram) entries. In Rokwire, capabilities and talents are build atop the Rokwire building blocks, which enable users to have a customized, privacy-assured experience. Your efforts will also help to facilitate adoption of the Rokwire platform, serve to establish a set of community standards, and participate in educational opportunities related to open-source. 
    
__Expected Outcomes__
We are interested in creating programming templates in the form of interactive programming. This will consist of breaking down the steps to creating things in Rokwire and demonstrating this to potential open-source contributors. These programming templates will be distributable in the form of video tutorials and digital notebooks. These templates will allow open-source contributors with limited understanding of the architecture to create their own capabilities and talents for inclusion as functionality in a community mobile app.

__Skills/requirements__
This project requires familiarity with some or all of the following languages: Python, Golang, Dart, and Flutter.

__Planned Effort__
Difficulty: __Moderate to Hard__. 350 hours. Mentors: Bradly Alicea (balicea@illinois.edu), Sandeep Puthanveetil Satheesan (sandeeps@illinois.edu)

#### Extended Reality (XR) for Open-source Community-building
Help the Rokwire Community to develop an extended reality (XR) infrastructure. The focus will be building upon the Mozilla platforms A-Frame (web framework), Mozilla Hubs (virtual rooms), and Spoke (3-D social scenes). 

__Expected Outcomes__
Your efforts will culminate in two outcomes. The first outcomes involves developing a pipeline of virtual experiences for education and collaboration in the Rokwire Community. Secondarily, we would like to develop Augmented Reality resources to be integrated into mobile apps. Contribute to our broader vision of smart communities in XR! 

__Skills/Requirements__
Familiarity with Unity or Blender is a must. Experience with C++, Python, or Java are desirable.

__Planned Effort__
Difficulty: __Easy__. 175 hours. Mentors: Bradly Alicea (balicea@illinois.edu).

#### Towhee Open Source Machine Learning Pipelines
Towhee is a flexible, application-oriented framework for running machine learning (ML) pipelines. It is a Python project that aims to make greatly simple anything2vec, allowing everyone - from beginner developers to large organizations - to deploy complex pipelines with just a few lines of code. It has become a common practice among the industry to drive data applications with neural network models. Applications involving embedding can be seen in all walks of life, such as product recommender system, copyright protection, data management, software security, new drug discovery, finance, insurance, etc. Despite the fact that the concept of "embed everything" has prevailed in academia and industry in recent years, how to embed unstructured data reasonably and efficiently based on business needs is still an urgent problem that has not yet been resolved. 
    
__Some of Towhee's key features include__    
* easy ML for everyone: Run a machine learning pipeline with less than five lines of code.

* rich operators and pipelines: Collaborate and share pipelines with the open source community.

* automatic versioning: Our versioning mechanism for pipelines and operators ensures that you never run into dependency hell. Support for fine-tuning models: Feed your dataset into our Trainer and get a new model in just a few easy steps.
    
* deploy to cloud (to be implemented): Ready-made pipelines can be deployed to the cloud with minimal effort.
    
__Expected Outcomes__
Contribute to our library of pipelines (improve upon or create anew). Work with the mentors to find problem doomains for the Towhee libraries. As a contributor to the Towhee project, you will be working towards making MLops significantly easier. Your efforts will also support the Towhee community by creating Interdisciplinary STEM pipelines which diversified audiences. 
    
__What can I do before GSoC?__
Find us on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/towhee-io), join our [Slack Channel](http://slack.towhee.io), follow us on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/towheeio), visit our [Towhee hub](https://towhee.io). Join our Office Hours every Thursday from 4-5pm PST.

You can also build a basic prototype for this project. Please feel free to join the Towhee Slack or attend our Office Hour to raise questions/discussions 
regarding your approach to the problem.
    
__Skills/requirements__
Pytorch and good understanding of python programming language along with interest in interdisciplinary research.

__Planned Effort__
Difficulty: __Moderate__. 350 hours Mentors: Krishna Katyal [(krishnakatyal5121@gmail.com)](mailto:krishnakatyal5121@gmail.com), Frank Liu [(frank.zijie@gmail.com)](mailto:frank.zijie@gmail.com).
