# A Collective Cognition Model for AI Ethics

## Co-Lab Notebooks

Included are Co-Lab Notebooks which detail the process of developing the computational model, including code examples.

## NetLogo Files

Included are NetLogo files for running the simulation of the model. The files use the NetLogo Python extension, and require installation of numpy, matplotlib (optional but useful), inferactively-pymdp, and tomsup
