An Adaptive model of Cybernetic Big Five Theory (CB5T)

The Big Five Theory can be more thoroughly analyzed with its traits for understanding how the human personality's components are interwoven and interrelated to one another. Behaviorial patterns by the biological structure of the brain itself, with results from the neuroscience of personality, can shed light on how the personality traits of the Big Five theory of personality, arguably the most prominent and trustworthy of personality theories, can be translated into the language of cybernetic theory. Turning to the work of Colin G. DeYoung, the cybernetic theory that was develoepd with the recent findings Personality Neuroscience. By observing and studying the correlatinos between brain structure and the Big Five scores, Personality Neuroscience also provides a way of determining how human behavior itself can be related to personality.  

Building off of the Big Five theory of personality, DeYoung developed the Cybernetic Big Five Theory (CB5T) when comparing the brains of individuals with similar scores on the Big Five personality test. After observing the correlations between brain structure and Big Five scores, he developed the field of Personality Neuroscience. With the cybernetic theory that can be used to explain empirical data with Personality Neuroscience, the Cybernetic Big Five Theory relied on the four layers of evolutionary behavioral patterns used in describing the correlations between the Big Five in Personality Neuroscience. (1) At the top are the two most abstract kinds of evolutounary behaviors with metatraits of stability and plasticity. (2) Alongside this, that are the traditional Big Five: neuroticisim, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness. (3) Then, withdrawal, volatility, compassion, politeness, industriousness, orderliness, enthusiasm, assertiveness, intellect, and openness comprise the third layer. (4) At the bottom, on the fourth layer, are facets. This way of looking at personality has its own limits, though. The cross-relationships are not covered in the heuristic, among other limitations.   

With the Circumplex Model of Personality by Strus, the Big Five Theory of Personality can be used to describe evolutionary behavioral patterns that deal with the relationships between CB5T and the interpersonal circumplex. CB5T describes behavioral patterns that increase our reproductive fitness, helping us deal with the complexity people normally deal with in the environment. Complexity is the sum of all possible states of all the variables in a system. Here, we look at Complexity Systems Science (CSS) for three requirements for dealing with complexity: Adaptability (the ability of the system to have many different possible actions in parallel), Efficiency (as the parts of the system arise together to perform the action at hand), and Scale(how complex the system is). We will focus on the first of the three as a way of interpretting the system in an ethical context.   

In the context of network systems, using many different possible actions available, the system can increase its compelxity to deal with the complexity of the environment. Here, we have a use of Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety (LRV): "to be effective, a system must be at least as complex as the environmental behaviors to which it must differentially react." 

Ashby's law of requisite variety tells us that a system needs to have a proportional variety of actions to respond to the variety of perturbations from its environment (the word variety here could be substituted for the word complexity). A hierarchy could also be necessary for coping with environmental complexity. 

We find a similar characteristic among Beer's Viable System Model (VSM), a cybernetic model used to structure organizations. The inspiration for VSM came from human beings, particularly in the nervous system and the human brain. With this model, there are five subsystems used for every viable system in order to survive:  

These five subsystems are: 
1. System I, the autonomous parts that take action. 
2. System II, coordinating parts that make sure that different autonomous systems I do not hurt each other in such a way that it threatens viability. 
3. System III runs the here and now internally as most efficiently as possible. 
4. System IV watches out for changes in the environment and in the future. 
5. System V is the ultimate decision making system in case System III and System IV are unable to come to terms as to the best course of action. If you compare VSM to CSS then System IV is the subsystem responsible for adaptability. System III is responsible for efficiency. The hierarchical levels between systems I and systems V create scale.

If you compare VSM to CSS then System IV is the subsystem responsible for adaptability. System III is responsible for efficiency. The hierarchical levels between systems I and systems V create scale.

For CSS and System IV of VSM, the behaviorial pattern of plasticity provides a way of understanding this type of adaptiveness as used with the Law of Requisite Variety. By adapting a little with efficiency,   

Given that plasticity is a behavioral pattern that gives us adaptability in terms of CSS and System IV in terms of VSM, if we adapt only a little we are probably more into doing the opposite. Which would be in terms of VSM System III. Which would mean in terms of CSS that if we only adapt a little that we are primarily concerned with efficiency. 

Deyoung also defines:
* Exploration - finding new goals and strategies in the inner world and the outer environment and the future 
* Exploitation - making the best use of known goals and strategies. 
* * Mostly in the external world, but also in the inner world by exploiting one's feelings. 
* * Taking into account psychopathologies, we find that if you do too much exploitation and too much efficiency, you are so much tied to what is known that exploitation becomes rigidity. And if you do too much (inner) exploration, exploration turns into psychosis.
