# Observations 

In the `results` folder, the results of differing initial conditions can be observed. Essentially, by varying the parameters of standard deviation and norm of initial conditions while keeping the number of agents constant, we can observe what sort of group patterns and behavior emerges.    

It's clear that agents of shades green and turqouise are far more likely to congregate together, and agents of shades pink and red are far more likely to be viewed as "loners." Groups of individuals also become more and more spaced away from one another as the number of more repulsive individuals increases.
