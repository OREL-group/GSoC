However, the calculator should gracefully handle this case and provide a user-friendly message or behavior.\nDescription: When attempting to divide by zero, the calculator should not rely on Python's default ZeroDivisionError. Instead, it should handle this case explicitly, either by returning a specific value (e.g., None or float('inf')) or by raising a custom error message that informs the user about the invalid operation. This change would improve the calculator's robustness and user experience.\nSystem Info:\nCalculator Project Version: 1.0.0\nPython Version: 3.8\nOperating System: Windows 10\n</issue>"

There is only one occurrence of the `/` operator (division) in the codebase, which is in the `divide` method.\n\nThese findings suggest that the issue is specific to the `Calculator` class and its `divide` method. The fact that there is only one occurrence of division in the codebase implies that this is a unique piece of logic that needs to be addressed.\n\nNow that we have gathered more context, let's think about how we can use this information to inform our patching efforts."
