Here is the patch for the issue:

```
# modification 1
```python
<file>calculator/calculator.py</file>
<original>
    def divide(self, a, b):
        return a / b
</original>
<patched>
    def divide(self, a, b):
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return a / b
</patched>
```

This patch adds a simple check to ensure that the divisor is not zero before performing the division. If the divisor is zero, it raises a `ValueError` with a user-friendly message.
