2024-06-19 19:22:12.704 | DEBUG    | Trying to select search APIs in json where text is Based on the issue description, I will use the following search APIs to gather more context:

1. `search_class(class_name: str)`: Search for the "Calculator" class in the codebase.
   Input: `class_name="Calculator"`

2. `search_method_in_file(method_name: str, file_path: str)`: Search for the "divide" method in a file where Calculator class is defined.
