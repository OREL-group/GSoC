However, the calculator should gracefully handle this case and provide a user-friendly message or behavior.\nDescription: When attempting to divide by zero, the calculator should not rely on Python's default ZeroDivisionError. Instead, it should handle this case explicitly, either by returning a specific value (e.g., None or float('inf')) or by raising a custom error message that informs the user about the invalid operation. This change would improve the calculator's robustness and user experience.\nSystem Info:\nCalculator Project Version: 1.0.0\nPython Version: 3.8\nOperating System: Windows 10\n</issue>"

The `Calculator` class is defined in the file `<file>calculator/calculator.py</file>` and has methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. The `divide` method is defined within the `Calculator` class and checks if the divisor (`b`) is zero before performing the division. If `b` is zero, it raises a `ValueError` with the message \"Cannot divide by zero.\"\n3. There are two occurrences of the `divide` method in the codebase, both of which have the same implementation.\n\nFrom this analysis, I can see that the issue report is correct: the calculator does handle division by zero, but it would be more robust to provide a user-friendly message or behavior instead of raising an error."
