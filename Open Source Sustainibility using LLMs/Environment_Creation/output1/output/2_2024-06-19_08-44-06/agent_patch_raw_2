I apologize for the mistake. Here is another attempt at writing a patch:

# modification 1
<file>calculator/calculator.py</file>
<original>def divide(self, a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    return a / b</original>
<patched>def divide(self, a, b):
    if b == 0:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero. Please try again.")
    else:
        return a / b</patched>

This patch modifies the `divide` method in the `calculator/calculator.py` file to provide a more user-friendly error message and handling for division by zero.
