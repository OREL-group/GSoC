I apologize for the mistake. Here is another attempt at writing a patch:

# modification 1
<file>calculator/calculator.py</file>
<original>from calculator import Calculator</original>
<patched>from calculator import Calculator
from typing import Union</patched>

This patch adds the `typing` module and imports the `Union` type to the `calculator/calculator.py` file.
