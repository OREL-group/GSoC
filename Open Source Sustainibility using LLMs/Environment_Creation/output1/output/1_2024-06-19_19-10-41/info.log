2024-06-19 19:11:50.989 | DEBUG    | Trying to select search APIs in json where text is Based on the issue description, I will use the following search APIs to gather more information about the project:

1. `search_class(class_name: str)`: To search for the `Calculator` class in the codebase.
   Input: `class_name='Calculator'`

2. `search_method_in_file(method_name: str, file_path: str)`: To search for methods related to trigonometry functions (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, etc.) in a specific file where these methods are likely implemented.
   Inputs:
   - `method_name='sin'`
   - `file_path='path_to_file.py'` (assuming the file path is known)

3. `search_method(method_name: str)`: To search for any existing trigonometry functions or related code in the entire codebase.
   Input: `method_name='sin'`

These API calls will help me understand how the calculator's functionality is currently implemented and where I can add new methods to support trigonometric operations.. Try 1 of 5.

2024-06-19 19:13:34.117 | DEBUG    | Trying to select search APIs in json where text is Based on my analysis, I don't need more context to proceed with solving the issue.

As for the bug locations, since there is no existing implementation of trigonometric functions like `sin`, I can infer that the new method `sin` needs to be added to the `Calculator` class in the file `calculator/calculator.py`.

So, my answers are:

* Do we need more context: No
* Where are bug locations: `<file>calculator/calculator.py</file>` (in the `Calculator` class). Try 1 of 5.
2024-06-19 19:13:43.857 | DEBUG    | Invalid json. Will retry.
