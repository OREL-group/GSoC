        "problem_statement": "Issue 1: Add Trigonometry Functionality\nTitle: Feature Request: Implement Trigonometry Functions in Calculator\n\nChecked Other Resources:\n\nI have thoroughly reviewed the calculator project's documentation.\nI searched GitHub and found no similar feature requests or implementations.\nThis feature request is to enhance the calculator's functionality, not to report a bug.\nExample Code:\n```python\nclass Calculator:\n    # Existing arithmetic operations...\n    \n    # Proposed method to add\n    def sin(self, angle):\n        # Implementation for sine function\n        pass\n```\n\nDescription: The calculator currently supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). To extend its capabilities and make it more useful for a broader range of mathematical calculations, I propose adding support for trigonometry functions, starting with the sine function. This addition would significantly enhance the calculator's utility, especially for users dealing with trigonometry problems.\n\nSystem Info:\n\nCalculator Project Version: 1.0.0\nPython Version: 3.8\nOperating System: Windows 10\n",
