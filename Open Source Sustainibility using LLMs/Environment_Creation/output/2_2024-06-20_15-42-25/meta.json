        "problem_statement": "Issue 2: Fix Division by Zero Handling\nTitle: Bug Report: Incorrect Handling of Division by Zero in Calculator\n\nChecked Other Resources:\n\nI have checked the calculator project's documentation for any notes on division behavior.\nI searched GitHub for similar bug reports and found none.\nI confirmed that this issue persists in the latest version of the calculator project.\nThis issue represents a bug in the calculator's logic, not an error in my code.\n\nBuggy Code:\nclass Calculator:\n    def divide(self, a, b):\n        return a / b  # Current implementation does not handle division by zero.\n\nError Message and Stack Trace (if applicable): No explicit error message since Python inherently throws a ZeroDivisionError when attempting to divide by zero. However, the calculator should gracefully handle this case and provide a user-friendly message or behavior.\n\nDescription: When attempting to divide by zero, the calculator should not rely on Python's default ZeroDivisionError. Instead, it should handle this case explicitly, either by returning a specific value (e.g., None or float('inf')) or by raising a custom error message that informs the user about the invalid operation. This change would improve the calculator's robustness and user experience.\n\nSystem Info:\n\nCalculator Project Version: 1.0.0\nPython Version: 3.8\nOperating System: Windows 10\n",
