To extend its capabilities and make it more useful for a broader range of mathematical calculations, I propose adding support for trigonometry functions, starting with the sine function. This addition would significantly enhance the calculator's utility, especially for users dealing with trigonometry problems.\nSystem Info:\nCalculator Project Version: 1.0.0\nPython Version: 3.8\nOperating System: Windows 10\n</issue>"

Each API call must have concrete arguments as inputs."
