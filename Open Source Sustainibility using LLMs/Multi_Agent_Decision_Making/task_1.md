Issue 1: Add Trigonometry Functionality
Title: Feature Request: Implement Trigonometry Functions in Calculator

Checked Other Resources:

I have thoroughly reviewed the calculator project's documentation.
I searched GitHub and found no similar feature requests or implementations.
This feature request is to enhance the calculator's functionality, not to report a bug.
Example Code:
```python
class Calculator:
    # Existing arithmetic operations...
    
    # Proposed method to add
    def sin(self, angle):
        # Implementation for sine function
        pass
```

Description: The calculator currently supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). To extend its capabilities and make it more useful for a broader range of mathematical calculations, I propose adding support for trigonometry functions, starting with the sine function. This addition would significantly enhance the calculator's utility, especially for users dealing with trigonometry problems.

System Info:

Calculator Project Version: 1.0.0
Python Version: 3.8
Operating System: Windows 10
