# LLAMOSC

Welcome to **LLAMOSC** (LLM Agent-Based Modeling for Open Source Communities), a cutting-edge framework designed to simulate and sustain open-source communities using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) techniques.

## Introduction

**LLAMOSC** stands for **LLM Agent-Based Modeling for Open Source Communities**. The name encapsulates the core components and objectives of the framework:

- **LLM**: Large Language Models, the backbone of our intelligent agents, providing them with advanced perception, reasoning, and decision-making capabilities.
- **ABM**: Agent-Based Modeling, the methodological approach we use to simulate the interactions and dynamics within open-source communities.
- **OSC**: Open Source Communities, the focus of our simulations, aiming to enhance sustainability, collaboration, and engagement within these communities.

## Purpose

The **LLAMOSC** framework aims to provide a realistic and dynamic simulation environment for open-source communities. By leveraging LLMs, our agents can interact, collaborate, and adapt in ways that closely mirror real-world scenarios. This approach helps in understanding and improving the sustainability and productivity of open-source projects.
