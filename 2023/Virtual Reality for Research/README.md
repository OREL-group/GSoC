# Virtual Reality Distributed Research Project:

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our distributed research project focused on virtual reality (VR) visualization and data analysis. This project comprises three sub-projects: Anatomy VR Visualization, C Elegans VR Visualization and Evolution Simulation, and Morris Water Maze(MWM) VR Visualization with ML/RL Agent Simulation. Each sub-project has its own set of assets and software components for data analysis.

## Sub-Project 1: Anatomy VR Visualization
The Anatomy VR Visualization sub-project aims to provide an immersive VR visualization of anatomical structures. The assets for this sub-project are ready and available in the corresponding folder. The VR visualization allows users to explore and interact with anatomical models in a three-dimensional environment.

## Sub-Project 2: C Elegans VR Visualization and Evolution Simulation
In the C Elegans VR Visualization and Evolution Simulation sub-project, we focus on visualizing C Elegans, a nematode commonly used in biological research, using VR technology. Additionally, this sub-project includes an evolution simulation. The assets for both the VR visualization and the evolution simulation can be found in their respective folders.

Furthermore, this sub-project includes a data analysis software component with features such as path tracking, video replay, and raw data analysis. Researchers can leverage this software to analyze and interpret the results obtained from the C Elegans VR visualization and evolution simulation.

## Sub-Project 3: Morris Water Maze VR Visualization with ML/RL Agent Simulation
The MWM VR Visualization with ML/RL Agent Simulation sub-project focuses on the Morris Water Maze (MWM) experiment from a human perspective. Researchers can configure the experiment online, and the VR visualization provides an immersive experience of the MWM setup. Moreover, this sub-project integrates an ML/RL agent simulation for the MWM experiment.

Similar to the previous sub-project, the MWM sub-project includes a data analysis software component with capabilities such as path tracking, video replay, and raw data analysis. Researchers can utilize this software to analyze the data collected from the MWM VR visualization and ML/RL agent simulation.
